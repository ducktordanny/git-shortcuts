> Some useful aliases that I'm using in the terminal. Planned to extend the list with time goes by.

## Installation

[[ -e ~/path_to_repo/main.sh ]] && emulate sh -c 'source ~/path_to_repo/main.sh'

## TODO

- More detailed description
- "installation" script? actually it has to be just added to zshr or bashrc...
